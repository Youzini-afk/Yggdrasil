# Protocol Commons Registry

Status: Experimental, descriptor schema version 1.

The Protocol Commons is the registry for shared semantics. A JSON shape alone is not a protocol: every registered protocol also names its lifecycle, error and cancellation model, authority boundary, behavioral vectors, compatibility profiles, migrations, and implementations. Registry entries do not receive routing priority, and an official provider is evaluated by the same vector set as any third-party provider.

## Descriptor

[`protocol-descriptor.schema.json`](v1/schemas/protocol-descriptor.schema.json) publishes `ProtocolDescriptor` (`urn:yggdrasil:protocol-descriptor:v1`). Its stable fields are:

- `protocol_id`, `version`, and `maturity`;
- JSON Schema and WIT-world references;
- semantic, lifecycle, and error-model document references;
- explicit authority requirements;
- protocol-owned conformance vector identifiers;
- compatibility profiles;
- migrations and adapters;
- implementation claims and the exact vector set used by each claim.

Document references may omit a digest while the referenced document is repository-local. A portable package or World Bundle must materialize such references as content-addressed artifacts before making a cross-host integrity claim.

`host.info` exposes `protocol_commons_registry_version` and the full descriptor registry. Phase 6 intentionally registers only:

| Protocol | Version | Profile | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ygg.change` | `1.0.0` | `ygg.change/default/v1` | Experimental |
| `ygg.shell.default` | `1.0.0` | `ygg.shell.default/v1` | Experimental |
| `ygg.world.bundle` | `1.0.0` | `ygg.world.bundle/experimental/v1` | Experimental |

Projection stays an Experimental canonical namespace, but is not admitted as an initial Protocol Commons descriptor. It needs two materially different experiences before shared semantics can be claimed.

## Negotiation

`ContractSelection.protocols[]` selects a protocol ID, version, and optional compatibility profile. Negotiation occurs before method resolution or handler execution.

- An exact supported version/profile produces a `NegotiatedProtocol` record.
- A declared legacy protocol/version uses the named adapter and reports that adapter in the negotiation result.
- An unsupported major produces `kernel/v1/error/unsupported_protocol` with `reason=protocol_major_mismatch`, supported/requested majors, and the available adapters.
- Unknown protocols and profiles fail explicitly. They never fall back to shape compatibility or a weaker profile.

The initial explicit adapter is `kernel.v1.proposal@1.0.0 → ygg.change@1.0.0` through `change.proposal.v1`.

## Conformance ownership

Protocol conformance and implementation/package conformance are different reports:

- `ProtocolConformanceReport` identifies the protocol, version, profile, and protocol-owned vector results.
- `ImplementationConformanceReport` additionally identifies the implementation and provider while retaining the same vector identifiers.
- `PackageConformanceReport` continues to assess the distribution envelope, declarations, handshake, permissions, streaming, and handle lifecycle.

The registry rejects implementation claims that omit a required vector, invent a vector outside the protocol descriptor, name an unknown profile, or claim a different protocol version. The Change descriptor includes an official runtime implementation and a test-only third-party reference claim; both are bound to the same four required vector IDs. `test_only` prevents that fixture from being presented as a portable production implementation.

The reports are executable independently:

```text
ygg conformance protocol --protocol ygg.change --json
ygg conformance protocol --protocol ygg.change --implementation ygg.runtime.change-proposal --json
ygg conformance package --path <package>
```

## Change protocol

The Change protocol references the additive Intent, ChangeSet, PolicyDecision, Commit, and EffectReceipt schemas. Its lifecycle, errors, authority rules, Proposal adapter, and behavioral evidence are defined in [`CHANGE_WORKFLOW.md`](CHANGE_WORKFLOW.en.md).

## Shell Default profile

`ygg.shell.default/v1` owns the vocabulary that maps structured contributions and sandboxed surface bundles into a shell. Existing fixed `SurfaceSlot` values are legacy vocabulary accepted through `shell.surface-slot.v1`; they are not substrate ontology.

The profile requires:

- public discovery through `shell.contribution.*`;
- bounded, package-owned structured metadata;
- an explicit surface bridge allowlist and session scope;
- no implicit kernel, filesystem, network, or host-UI authority;
- shell replacement without changing journal history, object identity, or receipts.

The current lifecycle and bridge error model are documented in [`SURFACE_HOSTING.md`](../guides/SURFACE_HOSTING.en.md).

## World Bundle Experimental profile

`ygg.world.bundle/experimental/v1` defines the portability proof target without adding `World` to the substrate. Its descriptor references event envelopes, artifact descriptors, effect receipts, and the concrete [`WORLD_BUNDLE.md`](WORLD_BUNDLE.en.md) archive/head/journal schemas.

The required vectors cover reference closure, cross-host import, offline replay, re-execution on a new branch, and shell independence. All five now pass against the real `official/playable-creation-board` pressure source, so `ygg.runtime.world-bundle` is registered as the first conforming production implementation claim.

## World Bundle lifecycle

The required lifecycle is `select head → compute closure → verify → export → import into an empty scope → audit/replay → optionally re-execute on a new branch`. Import never treats host paths, process IDs, URLs, or package-local runtime handles as portable identity.

## World Bundle error model

Bundle processing fails explicitly for a missing object, digest or size mismatch, incomplete transitive reference closure, incompatible protocol major, unsupported required profile, altered original envelope, unresolved policy reference, or an attempted historical replay that would execute an external effect. Unknown artifact types are preserved and copied rather than discarded.
