# Experience Runtime Authoring Guide

> English · [中文](./EXPERIENCE_RUNTIME_AUTHORING.md)

This guide explains how to create, inspect, checkpoint, recover, and replace experience-runtime packages in Yggdrasil.

## Overview

Experience runtime defines how ordinary package-owned experiences run continuously, pause, recover, checkpoint, and fork. Agentic Forge can change them through proposals. All experience semantics live at the package layer; nothing enters the kernel.v1.

Key constraints:
- No `kernel.v1.experience.*`, `kernel.v1.world.*`, `kernel.v1.turn.*`, `kernel.v1.chat.*`, or `kernel.v1.memory.*`.
- Experience packages are ordinary packages with no kernel privilege.
- Experience descriptors, state projections, checkpoints, and recovery plans are package-owned artifacts, not kernel primitives.
- All behavior goes through the public protocol.

## Generating an experience-runtime package

```bash
ygg init-package ./my-experience \
  --id example/my-experience \
  --entry subprocess \
  --language typescript \
  --template experience-runtime
```

The generated package includes:
- 4 surfaces: `experience_entry`, `play_renderer`, `forge_panel`, `assistant_action`
- 6 capabilities: `describe-contract`, `create-checkpoint`, `inspect-checkpoint`, `draft-recovery`, `bind-agent-run`, `echo`
- No network declarations, no raw secrets, no forbidden kernel namespaces

## Experience Descriptor

The experience descriptor (`experience_runtime_descriptor`) is package-owned experience metadata:

```typescript
const desc = createExperienceDescriptor({
  package_id: "example/my-experience",
  surfaces: {
    experience_entry: "example/my-experience/entry",
    play_renderer: "example/my-experience/play",
    forge_panel: "example/my-experience/forge",
    assistant_action: "example/my-experience/assist",
  },
  capabilities: {
    describe_contract: "example/my-experience/describe-contract",
    create_checkpoint: "example/my-experience/create-checkpoint",
    inspect_checkpoint: "example/my-experience/inspect-checkpoint",
    draft_recovery: "example/my-experience/draft-recovery",
    bind_agent_run: "example/my-experience/bind-agent-run",
  },
});
```

Validate a descriptor:

```typescript
const errors = validateExperienceDescriptor(desc);
if (errors.length > 0) {
  // descriptor does not conform to the contract
}
```

## State Projection

A state projection is a package-level snapshot of the current experience state:

```typescript
const projection = createStateProjection({
  package_id: "example/my-experience",
  session_id: "session-123",
  state: { health: 100, step_index: 5, location: "forest" },
  capability_id: "example/my-experience/describe-contract",
});
```

## Checkpoint

Checkpoints are persistent snapshots of experience state. They support three formats:

| Format | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `snapshot` | Full state snapshot |
| `incremental` | Incremental snapshot (based on previous checkpoint) |
| `delta` | Only stores differences |

```typescript
const checkpoint = createCheckpoint({
  package_id: "example/my-experience",
  session_id: "session-123",
  state_snapshot: { health: 100, step_index: 5, location: "forest" },
  asset_refs: ["asset:scene:forest", "asset:character:hero"],
  branch_ref: "branch:target:main",
  sequence: 3,
  capability_id: "example/my-experience/create-checkpoint",
});

// Inspect checkpoint
const inspection = inspectCheckpoint(checkpoint);
// inspection.valid === true/false
```

## Recovery

Recovery is a plan for restoring an experience after failure. It supports five strategies:

| Strategy | Needs checkpoint | Needs approval |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| `restore_last_checkpoint` | Yes | No |
| `replay_from_checkpoint` | Yes | Yes |
| `restart_session` | No | Yes |
| `manual_intervention` | No | Yes |
| `discard_and_reset` | No | Yes |

```typescript
const recoveryPlan = draftRecoveryPlan({
  package_id: "example/my-experience",
  session_id: "session-123",
  failure_kind: "state_corruption",
  last_checkpoint_ref: "checkpoint:session-123:3",
  capability_id: "example/my-experience/draft-recovery",
});
```

## Play Surface Subscription

The Play surface supports three subscription types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `state_change` | State change notifications |
| `checkpoint` | Checkpoint creation notifications |
| `lifecycle` | Lifecycle event notifications |

```typescript
const subscription = createPlaySurfaceSubscription({
  package_id: "example/my-experience",
  session_id: "session-123",
  surface_id: "example/my-experience/play",
  subscription_type: "state_change",
  capability_id: "example/my-experience/describe-contract",
});
```

## Forge/Assist Bindings

### Forge Binding

Forge panel bindings connect the Forge surface to an experience session, supporting inspection and proposals:

```typescript
const forgeBinding = createForgeBinding({
  package_id: "example/my-experience",
  session_id: "session-123",
  surface_id: "example/my-experience/forge",
  inspect_capabilities: ["example/my-experience/describe-contract"],
  proposal_capabilities: ["example/my-experience/draft-recovery"],
  capability_id: "example/my-experience/bind-agent-run",
});
```

### Assist Binding

Assist bindings use `fork_then_approve` policy to ensure all modifications go through proposals:

```typescript
const assistBinding = createAssistBinding({
  package_id: "example/my-experience",
  session_id: "session-123",
  surface_id: "example/my-experience/assist",
  action_capabilities: ["example/my-experience/draft-recovery"],
  capability_id: "example/my-experience/bind-agent-run",
});
```

## Agent Run Binding

Experiences can connect to Agentic Forge via `bind_agent_run`:

- Agent run is scoped to a branch
- Agent explores in a scratch branch
- Agent produces candidates/proposals (never directly modifies target)
- Experience inspects/approves/rejects through Forge/Assist

## Third-Party Replacement

Experience-runtime packages are ordinary packages. Any third-party package that satisfies the same surface and capability contract can replace them. Replacement rules:

- Same surface slots (experience_entry, play_renderer, forge_panel, assistant_action)
- Same capability shape
- No official priority
- Declare replacement via composition descriptor

## Red Lines

The following are strictly prohibited:

1. Kernel experience namespace: events, proposals, checkpoints, or any output must never contain `kernel.v1.experience.*`, `kernel.v1.world.*`, `kernel.v1.turn.*`, `kernel.v1.chat.*`, or `kernel.v1.memory.*`.
2. Raw secrets: all secrets must use `secret_ref` references. Checkpoints, recovery plans, and state projections must not contain raw secrets.
3. Direct target branch mutation: agent changes to experiences must go through the proposal lifecycle. They must not directly modify the target branch.
4. Network access: experience-runtime packages do not use the network by default. If network is needed, `permissions.network.declarations` must be declared.
5. Kernel privilege: experience packages have no kernel privilege.

## TypeScript SDK

`sdk/typescript/experience-runtime` provides a pure TypeScript SDK. It has no dependencies and exposes no private runtime.

```typescript
import {
  createExperienceDescriptor,
  validateExperienceDescriptor,
  createStateProjection,
  createCheckpoint,
  inspectCheckpoint,
  draftRecoveryPlan,
  createPlaySurfaceSubscription,
  createForgeBinding,
  createAssistBinding,
  blockRawSecrets,
  hasKernelExperienceNamespace,
} from "../../sdk/typescript/experience-runtime/index.js";
```
