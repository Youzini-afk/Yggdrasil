//! Content-free outbound executor abstraction (M3 + L2).
//!
//! This module defines the outbound executor boundary: the trait,
//! request/response types, and built-in deny-all, fake, and live HTTP
//! executors. No real network I/O happens in the deny-all or fake
//! executors. The live HTTP executor (L2) uses `reqwest` with rustls,
//! is HTTPS-only, disabled by default, and records only shape/audit
//! metadata — never raw auth/body content.
//!
//! Design principles:
//! - Fail-closed: default executor is `DenyAllOutboundExecutor`.
//! - Content-free: `body_shape` carries the JSON shape of the request
//!   body (e.g. `{"model": "...", "messages": [...]}`), but the raw
//!   body bytes are never persisted in audit records.
//! - `secret_refs` are references only; resolved secrets are never
//!   echoed back or stored.
//! - No provider-specific fields in core; opaque `metadata` for
//!   executor-specific data.
//! - This boundary secures the Ygg-provided outbound path. It does not
//!   claim to intercept arbitrary subprocess OS network calls.
//! - Live executor is opt-in only; `RuntimeConfig::default()` uses
//!   `DenyAll`. Live executor rejects non-HTTPS URLs, does not follow
//!   redirects by default, and never echoes raw headers/body in
//!   response shapes.
