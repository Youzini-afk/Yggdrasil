# Yggdrasil Desktop

Tauri 2.x shell around the shared `clients/web` platform UI. Desktop owns a
loopback-only `ygg host serve` sidecar and loads the UI from that Host after a
health check, keeping RPC, SSE, project surfaces, and proxies same-origin.

## Development

Prerequisites:
- Rust stable
- Node.js 20+
- Linux: `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf libgtk-3-dev libsoup-3.0-dev`
- macOS: Xcode command-line tools
- Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools + WebView2

Run:
```bash
npm install
npm install --prefix ../web
npm run dev    # builds Web + sidecar, then starts the managed desktop shell
```

Build:
```bash
npm run build
```

The workspace target directory owns the output. With an explicit target triple,
installers are under `../../target/<triple>/release/bundle/`.

For Web-only HMR, run `npm run dev --prefix ../web`; it continues to proxy a
separately started Host on port 8787. The managed Desktop path intentionally
uses a built Web bundle so its random-port, same-origin behavior matches release.

## Managed Host boundary

`scripts/stage-sidecar.mjs` builds the CLI for the selected Rust target and
stages it as Tauri's `ygg-host` external binary. On launch Desktop:

- creates or merges a writable `<data>/profiles/desktop.yaml` instead of using the transient in-memory Host defaults;
- configures a profile-relative SQLite event store (`desktop-events.sqlite`) so sessions, runtime projections, deployment jobs, and revisions survive Desktop restarts;
- copies bundled official manifests into `<data>/desktop/official-packages/` and autoloads git, integrity, install, Docker runtime, project intake, secret store, and workspace labs in dependency-safe order;
- binds the Host to an OS-assigned `127.0.0.1` port;
- supplies a per-launch token through the child environment, never argv;
- waits for the stable listen handshake and `/healthz`;
- navigates the hidden window to the Host with a one-time bootstrap token;
- terminates the child when the application exits.

Existing custom autoload entries are preserved when the generated profile is refreshed. The bundled profile enables the package capabilities needed for installation and deployment, but it does not enable unrestricted local execution or outbound access; those remain deny-all unless a user-owned profile explicitly grants them.

The managed loopback Host remains the default and continues serving the Desktop UI. From Settings → Host connections, the shared client can explicitly select an HTTPS remote Host; credentials and project/target preferences are isolated per Host, and an unreachable or invalid remote can always fall back to the managed Host. Remote project surfaces are sandboxed using the selected Host's `surface-frame.html`, so that Host must serve a matching Web static bundle when surface rendering is required.

Run `npm run smoke:sidecar` after staging to verify the handshake, health route,
unauthenticated denial, and authenticated RPC against the real child process.

## Icons

The v0 wrapper uses generated solid-color placeholder PNG icons. Replace
them with branded icons and generate platform-specific `.icns` and `.ico`
assets before a polished desktop release.
