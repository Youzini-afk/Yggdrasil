# Contract Layering Matrix (Candidate)

> [English](./CONTRACT_LAYERING_MATRIX.en.md) · [中文](./CONTRACT_LAYERING_MATRIX.md)

> Status: candidate classification. This document does not change current
> `kernel.v1.*` runtime behavior. The operative specification remains
> [`KERNEL_V1_CONTRACT.md`](KERNEL_V1_CONTRACT.en.md); target principles are in
> [`CONSTITUTION_V2.md`](../architecture/CONSTITUTION_V2.en.md).

## Purpose

Contract V1 currently carries constitutional mechanisms, host control, deployment, protocol semantics, and product-shell concerns. This document answers, item by item:

1. who owns the contract today;
2. which layer should own it long term;
3. whether it is retained, moved, split, or replaced;
4. how `kernel.v1.*` clients continue working through compatibility adapters.

Target names in this document identify owners and concepts, not frozen final wire method IDs. Final namespaces are selected when the compatibility router is implemented.

## Layer and disposition codes

| Code | Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| `S` | Constitutional Substrate | Identity, authority, objects, journals, invocation, streams, transactions, receipts |
| `H` | Host Control Plane | Local installation, processes, ports, proxies, secrets, deployment, diagnostics |
| `C` | Protocol Commons | Shared semantics, state machines, change workflow, projection, and other evolvable protocols |
| `P` | Shell / Product Profile | Home, Forge, surface slots, bundle mounting, and interaction mapping |
| `X` | Split | The current contract mixes multiple owners and must be decomposed |
| `L` | Legacy Adapter | Reads or transforms an old contract only; receives no new semantics |

Dispositions:

- **Retain:** semantics belong to the target layer; only namespace and conformance separation are required.
- **Strengthen:** ownership and object model are substantially correct, but safety, audit, or portability guarantees are incomplete.
- **Reshape:** the capability remains, but the object model or boundary becomes more general.
- **Move:** behavior remains substantially intact while ownership leaves the kernel.
- **Split:** one old method becomes operations owned by multiple layers.
- **Replace:** the old abstraction is available only through an adapter to a new model.

## Current factual baseline

- Code contains 80 `KernelMethod` variants and 80 method schemas.
- Code, schemas, and `EVENT_KIND_REGISTRY.md` all contain 59 kernel events, including `kernel/v1/deployment.health`.
- There are 15 top-level schemas. Phase 2 added `contract-selection.schema.json`, Phase 4 added `artifact-descriptor.schema.json`, Phase 5 added EffectReceipt plus four Change primitive schemas, and Phase 6 added `protocol-descriptor.schema.json`.
- Known drift among `KernelMethod::status()`, Contract documentation, and actual dispatch is aligned and test-enforced.
- The Experimental method contract registry, centralized alias resolution, explicit profile/version negotiation, and identity adapters are implemented. Phase 3 publishes 36 canonical/legacy dual-stack routes across the Host Control Plane, host bundle resolver, Shell contributions, Change/Proposal, and Projection.
- The Experimental Protocol Commons registry publishes Change, Shell Default, and World Bundle descriptors, negotiates explicit protocol/profile selections before dispatch, and separates protocol, implementation, and package reports.
- The Web client still defaults to legacy `kernel.v1.*` IDs; generated SDKs derive canonical clients and explicit legacy wrappers from schema metadata and reject duplicate wire IDs, function names, or operation IDs before generation.

The first migration requirement is therefore a testable compatibility router, not code deletion.

## V1 compatibility obligations

Every migration implementation satisfies:

1. Old method names route through an explicit alias registry, not scattered `match` special cases.
2. An alias records canonical target, request adapter, response adapter, deprecation state, and support window.
3. `host.info` returns every contract layer, version, profile, alias, and maturity. Clients choose explicitly and do not silently downgrade.
4. Original v1 request/response/event JSON is retained losslessly; unknown fields survive transfer.
5. Old SDKs continue working. New SDKs are split into substrate/host/protocol/shell packages with a legacy umbrella client.
6. Conformance is split into substrate, host, protocol-profile, shell-profile, and legacy-adapter suites.
7. A legacy alias is removed only after migration tooling, support window, and replacement conformance all exist.

The implementation route is defined in [`CONTRACT_V2_MIGRATION.md`](../roadmap/CONTRACT_V2_MIGRATION.en.md).
