# Yggdrasil Documentation

> [English](./README.en.md) · [中文](./README.md)

Topic-grouped navigation for the developer docs. Every doc has both English and Simplified Chinese versions; the bilingual blockquote at the top of each file switches between them. When writing docs, follow [`STYLE.md`](STYLE.en.md).

## Newcomer 1 / 2 / 3 path

1. Read [`CHARTER.md`](CHARTER.en.md) → [`architecture/VISION.md`](architecture/VISION.en.md) → [`product/PLAY_CREATION_MODEL.md`](product/PLAY_CREATION_MODEL.en.md) for the platform stance.
2. Read [`architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`](architecture/ARCHITECTURE.en.md) → [`architecture/PLATFORM_KERNEL.md`](architecture/PLATFORM_KERNEL.en.md) → [`architecture/CAPABILITY_PACKAGE.md`](architecture/CAPABILITY_PACKAGE.en.md) for the three-tier architecture and its boundaries.
3. Walk through [`guides/PACKAGE_AUTHORING_WALKTHROUGH.md`](guides/PACKAGE_AUTHORING_WALKTHROUGH.en.md) to ship a first capability package.

After that, hop into the relevant guide / spec / roadmap on demand.

## Stance and status

- [`CHARTER.md`](CHARTER.en.md) — permanent principles
- [`ALPHA_STATUS.md`](ALPHA_STATUS.en.md) — living snapshot of done / partial / deferred
