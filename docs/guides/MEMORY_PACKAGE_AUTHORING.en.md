# Memory Package Authoring Guide

> [English](./MEMORY_PACKAGE_AUTHORING.en.md) · [中文](./MEMORY_PACKAGE_AUTHORING.md)

This guide explains how to author, replace, and consume package-owned long-term memory and knowledge in Yggdrasil. Memory is an ordinary package capability, not a kernel service.

## Core Principles

1. **Package-owned memory.** Memory records, retrieval, updates, corrections, and redaction plans are owned by ordinary capability packages — not by `kernel.memory.*`.
2. **No official priority.** `official/memory-lab` is one implementation. Third-party packages like `thirdparty/memory-lab` are fully interchangeable.
3. **Proposal-gated mutations.** Memory updates, corrections, and forget/redaction produce proposal drafts or plans. They never directly mutate trusted state or delete records. Consumers must approve before application.
4. **Deterministic, no-network, no inference.** The reference memory-lab implementation is fully deterministic. It does not require network, embedding APIs, or model inference. Third-party packages may add such capabilities through their own outbound/network permissions.
5. **Branch-aware.** Memory records are scoped to branches. Retrieval and views can filter by branch reference.
6. **Raw-secret blocking.** All capability inputs are scanned for raw secrets. Raw API keys, tokens, and passwords are rejected with `redaction_state: unsafe_blocked`. Use `secret_ref` references instead.
7. **No forbidden namespaces.** Memory packages must not reference `kernel.memory.*`, `kernel.experience.*`, `kernel.world.*`, `kernel.scene.*`, `kernel.turn.*`, `kernel.chat.*`, `kernel.agent.*`, `kernel.model.*`, `kernel.prompt.*`, or `kernel.director.*`.

## Memory Lab Capability Contract

`official/memory-lab` provides 9 capabilities:

| Capability | Purpose | Output Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `describe_memory_contract` | Describe the package contract | `memory_lab_contract` |
| `record_memory` | Record a memory entry | `memory_record` |
| `retrieve_memory` | Retrieve matching memories | `retrieval_result` |
| `trace_retrieval` | Show how retrieval matched | `retrieval_trace` |
| `draft_memory_update` | Draft a proposal-gated update | `memory_update_draft` |
| `apply_memory_correction` | Produce a correction shape | `memory_correction` |
| `draft_forget_redaction` | Draft a redaction plan | `memory_redaction_plan` |
| `branch_memory_view` | View memories scoped by branch | `memory_branch_view` |
| `explain_memory_provenance` | Explain record provenance | `memory_provenance` |

### Surfaces

- **forge_panel**: Inspect memory records, traces, drafts, corrections, redaction plans, and provenance.
- **assistant_action**: Draft approval-gated updates, corrections, or redaction plans.
- **home_card**: Record and retrieve memories.

## Memory Record

A `memory_record` has:

- `record_id`: Deterministic ID derived from key + content address.
- `record_kind`: One of `fact`, `preference`, `observation`, `correction`, `summary`, `context`.
- `key`: Lookup key for the record.
- `content`: The record content (arbitrary value).
- `content_address`: Stable content-addressed hash (FNV-1a 64-bit).
- `branch_ref`: The branch this record belongs to.
- `disclosure`: AI-generated / live-generated / unspecified metadata.
- `source_refs`: Protocol-visible source references.
- `knowledge_refs`: Optional cross-references to knowledge-lab entries.

## Retrieval

`retrieve_memory` uses deterministic keyword matching (case-insensitive substring). It supports branch-aware filtering: when `branch_ref` is specified, only records from that branch are considered.

`trace_retrieval` produces a detailed trace showing each step of the retrieval algorithm.

## Proposal-Gated Update

`draft_memory_update` produces a `memory_update_draft` with:

- `update_kind`: `add_record`, `modify_record`, `correct_record`, `forget_record`, `merge_records`.
- `requires_user_approval`: always `true`.
- `plan_only`: always `true` — no direct state mutation.
- `content_address`: Stable hash of the draft.

Consumers must approve and apply the draft through the proposal lifecycle.

## Correction

`apply_memory_correction` produces a `memory_correction` shape:

- `original_record_ref`: Reference to the record being corrected.
- `corrected_content`: The corrected content.
- `requires_user_approval`: always `true`.
- `content_address`: Stable hash.

## Forget / Redaction

`draft_forget_redaction` produces a `memory_redaction_plan`:

- `target_record_refs`: Records targeted for redaction.
- `redaction_scope`: `record_only` or broader.
- `status`: `draft` (requires approval before becoming `applied`).
- `plan_only`: always `true` — no direct deletion.
- `requires_user_approval`: always `true`.

The redaction plan is a proposal. The actual deletion/redaction happens only after explicit user approval.

## Branch-Aware View

`branch_memory_view` supports scopes:

- `current_branch`: Records from the specified branch only.
- `all_branches`: Records from all branches.
- `specified_branch`: Same as current_branch (explicit).
- `branch_diff`: Records grouped by branch for comparison.

## Provenance

`explain_memory_provenance` produces a chain where each step has:

- `step`: `record_created`, `record_retrieved`, `update_drafted`, `correction_applied`, `redaction_planned`, `branch_viewed`, `provenance_traced`.
- `ref`: Protocol-visible reference.
- `content_address`: Stable content-addressed hash.
- `description`: Human-readable explanation.

## Cross-Package Integration

The `official/playable-creation-board` includes optional `memory_refs` in its `request_change` output:

- `memory_package_id`: The memory package to use (default `official/memory-lab`).
- `retrieve_context_plan`: Describes how to retrieve memory context for change planning (optional, the board runs without it).
- `knowledge_refs`: Optional cross-references to knowledge-lab entries.

This is an optional cross-reference. The board does not depend on memory-lab to operate.

## Third-Party Replacement

`thirdparty/memory-lab` proves that `official/memory-lab` has no special priority:

- Same 9 capabilities, 3 surfaces.
- Same output shapes (`memory_record`, `retrieval_trace`, `update_draft`, `correction`, `redaction_plan`, `branch_view`, `provenance`).
- Loaded via `examples/compositions/memory-lab-replacement/composition.yaml`.
- Official `memory-lab` is listed as a `replacement_candidate`, not a default provider.

## What This Is Not

- **Not a RAG product.** The reference implementation uses deterministic keyword matching, not vector search or embedding APIs.
- **Not a chat memory system.** There are no conversation turns, messages, or prompt semantics.
- **Not kernel memory.** No `kernel.memory.*` methods or namespaces exist.
- **Not the only way.** Third-party packages can provide different retrieval algorithms, storage backends, or embedding-based matching through ordinary package capabilities.
