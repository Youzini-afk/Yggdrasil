# Event Model

> [English](./EVENT_MODEL.en.md) · [中文](./EVENT_MODEL.md)

The event log is the kernel's source of truth. It is organized by session, append-only, durable, and ordered.

The kernel does not interpret event payloads. Meaning is owned by capability packages.

## Envelope

Every persisted event uses the same envelope:

```text
EventEnvelope
- id                  unique event id
- session_id          target session
- sequence            monotonic per session
- timestamp           kernel-assigned
- writer_package_id   the package that produced the event (or "kernel")
- kind                namespaced string, e.g. "kernel/session.opened" or "org/name/event/foo"
- schema_version      payload schema version, owned by the writer
- payload             opaque JSON, validated only against the writer's declared schema
- metadata            opaque JSON; causation_id, correlation_id, trace ids, etc.
```

The kernel:

- assigns `id`, `sequence`, `timestamp`, and `writer_package_id`,
- enforces that `kind` is namespaced under the writer's id (or `kernel/...` for kernel events),
- validates `payload` against the writer's declared schema when one is declared,
- treats `metadata` as opaque.

## Kinds

Event kinds fall into two groups.

### Kernel-emitted kinds

The kernel itself produces a small fixed set. These kinds describe kernel operations, not content.

Session:

```text
kernel/session.opened
kernel/session.closed
kernel/session.forked
```

Package lifecycle:

```text
kernel/package.loading
kernel/package.starting
kernel/package.ready
kernel/package.stopping
kernel/package.stopped
kernel/package.loaded
kernel/package.unloaded
kernel/package.degraded
kernel/package.log
```

Capability invocation (planned audit shape):

```text
kernel/capability.invoked
kernel/capability.completed
kernel/capability.failed
```

Permission audit:

```text
kernel/permission.granted
kernel/permission.revoked
kernel/permission.denied
```

Generic substrate:

```text
kernel/asset.put
kernel/projection.updated
```

Proposal lifecycle:

```text
kernel/proposal.created
kernel/proposal.approved
kernel/proposal.rejected
kernel/proposal.applied
kernel/proposal.failed
```

Transport / runtime errors (planned):

```text
kernel/error
```

These are the only event kinds the kernel knows about by name. Their payloads describe kernel operations, not content.

### Package-emitted kinds

Everything else belongs to packages. Each package defines its own event kinds in its manifest, namespaced under its package id. These examples are illustrative and not part of the kernel:

```text
someorg/conversation/turn.started
someorg/conversation/prompt.rendered
someorg/conversation/model.streamed
someorg/world-sim/tick.completed
someorg/memory-pack/proposal.created
```

The kernel persists these and orders them. It does not understand them.

## Permissions

Appending an event requires `events.append` in the writer's manifest. Reading an event stream requires `events.read`, and may be scoped to specific sessions.

A package cannot append events under another package's namespace. Cross-package coordination should use capability invocations or extension points, not impersonation in the log.

## Persistence rules

- Append-only. The log is never edited.
- Per-session ordering is monotonic. The kernel makes no cross-session ordering claim.
- Durable. After `kernel/event.after_append` fires, the event is committed.
- Replayable. The kernel can stream events from `sequence` 0 forward.

## Replay

The kernel can replay events to:

- a newly subscribing client,
- a newly loaded package that requested catch-up,
- a snapshot tool.

The kernel replays envelopes verbatim. Meaning, projection, and state reconstruction belong to packages.

## Versioning

Each event kind carries a `schema_version`. The owning writer is responsible for migrations. The kernel does not migrate payloads; it persists what was written at the time.

A package can publish a new `schema_version` for its kind without changing the kernel.

## Causation and correlation

The envelope's `metadata` may carry `causation_id` (the event that caused this one) and `correlation_id` (a logical trace). The kernel treats them as opaque. Packages decide what they mean.

## What this model deliberately omits

- No chat history concept.
- No turn or message concept.
- No prompt frame, context plan, or model call concept.
- No memory or world-state concept.
- No agent task or proposal concept.

Packages that need these concepts may define them as their own event kinds. None of them are kernel events.

## Stability

The kernel-emitted kind set is small by design. Adding a new kernel kind needs the same justification as adding a new kernel responsibility: it truly cannot live in a package.
