# Conformance Matrix

> [English](./CONFORMANCE_MATRIX.en.md) · [中文](./CONFORMANCE_MATRIX.md)

The conformance suite is the executable guardian of the charter. It proves both positive behavior and rejection behavior. New cases land here as they are added. Cases marked partial or future remain in scope for later hardening; see `docs/roadmap/NEXT_STEPS.md`.

## Current release-gate command

```bash
cargo test --workspace
cargo run -p ygg-cli -- conformance
```

The current matrix records implemented conformance coverage. Named CLI cases and crate/service unit tests support these results. Current CLI conformance total: **362**.

## Conformance Feedback Loop

The conformance command supports filtering, timing, and diagnostics. See [`docs/performance/CONFORMANCE_FEEDBACK.en.md`](../performance/CONFORMANCE_FEEDBACK.en.md) and [`docs/performance/PERFORMANCE_AND_CODE_HEALTH.en.md`](../performance/PERFORMANCE_AND_CODE_HEALTH.en.md).

```bash
# List all case ids and tags
cargo run -p ygg-cli -- conformance --list

# Filter by substring
cargo run -p ygg-cli -- conformance --case sharing_lab

# Filter by tag
cargo run -p ygg-cli -- conformance --tag sharing

# Fail-fast
cargo run -p ygg-cli -- conformance --fail-fast

# Custom slowest report
cargo run -p ygg-cli -- conformance --slowest 3
```
