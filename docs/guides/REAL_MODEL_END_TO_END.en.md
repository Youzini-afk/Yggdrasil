# Real Model End-to-End Calls

> [English](./REAL_MODEL_END_TO_END.en.md) · [中文](./REAL_MODEL_END_TO_END.md)

This guide follows the real path from a user pressing Send in the YdlTavern surface to an OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini API response appearing back on screen. The path goes through the public protocol, a project session, package permissions, `secret_ref` resolution, and the host outbound executor.

This is not a kernel-level model API. Model semantics belong to the YdlTavern engine package. The kernel provides sessions, permissions, capability invocation, outbound execution, and audit boundaries.

## Complete call chain

```text
User types a message in the YdlTavern surface + clicks Send
  ↓
SendForm.onSend(text)
  ↓
TavernShell → TavernProvider.sendMessage(text)
  ↓ (local: add user message to chat state)
  ↓
invokeCapability("ydltavern/engine/model.live_call", { ... })
  ↓ (postMessage to the surface-host iframe parent)
  ↓
clients/web main thread receives RPC and calls client.invokeWithSession(method, params, sessionId)
  ↓ (HTTP POST /rpc with session_id)
  ↓
ygg host serve routes to dispatch_capability_invoke
  ↓ (sets ProtocolContext.session_id and ProtocolContext.principal=Package)
  ↓
inproc dispatcher finds the ydltavern-engine package (subprocess)
  ↓ (subprocess JSON-RPC call)
  ↓
ydltavern-engine runs the capability handler
  ↓ (builds an OpenAI/Anthropic/Gemini-shaped request)
  ↓
reverse-calls kernel.v1.outbound.execute with secret_headers: {Authorization: secret_ref}
  ↓
host dispatch_outbound_execute handles:
  ✓ checks the package permissions.network.declarations allow this host
  ✓ checks the package permissions.secret_refs declare this ref
  ✓ Runtime::resolve_secret_ref_with_session resolves ref → real value
    ├─ through CompositeSecretResolver
    ├─ secret_ref:store:* → StoreSecretResolver → decrypt ~/.yggdrasil/secrets.dat
    ├─ secret_ref:project:* → ProjectStoreSecretResolver
    │   ├─ uses ACTIVE_PROJECT_SCOPE task-local to read session.metadata.project_id
    │   ├─ decrypts ~/.yggdrasil/projects/<id>/secrets.dat
    │   ├─ missing + fallback_to_platform default true → platform store
    │   └─ missing + fallback disabled → fail closed
    └─ secret_ref:env:* → EnvSecretResolver (allowlist)
  ↓
LiveHttpOutboundExecutor builds an HTTPS request and injects headers
  ↓
Real HTTPS call to api.openai.com / api.anthropic.com / etc.
  ↓
Response flows back up the reverse path until the surface receives a string
  ↓
TavernProvider.sendMessage parses text with extractContentFromResult
  ↓
Assistant message content updates → React re-renders → user sees the reply
```

## Configuring real calls (user view)

Start the Yggdrasil host and web shell:

```bash
# 1. Start the host
ygg host serve --profile profiles/forge-alpha.yaml --http 127.0.0.1:8787 &

# 2. Start clients/web
cd clients/web && npm run dev

# 3. Open http://localhost:5173 in a browser
```

Then in the UI:

1. The Home screen shows the YdlTavern card if it has been installed with `yg install`.
2. Click Play.
3. The project becomes Running.
4. The host creates a project session.
5. The surface bundle is resolved and mounted in an iframe.
6. Open the API Connections drawer.
7. Choose an OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini provider.
8. Paste the API key.
9. Choose a save scope: Platform-wide (default) or This project only.
10. Click Save.
11. Close the drawer.
12. Type a message.
13. Click Send.
14. A real provider response should appear in the chat.

Platform-wide saves as `secret_ref:store:*`. This project only saves as `secret_ref:project:*` and is preferred only for the current project.

## Configuring real calls (developer view)

The host profile must explicitly enable resolvers and live outbound. Example:

```yaml
# profiles/forge-with-live-models.yaml
secret_resolver:
  store_enabled: true              # resolves secret_ref:store:* / project:*
  env_allowlist:                   # allowlist for secret_ref:env:*
    - OPENAI_API_KEY
    - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
    - GEMINI_API_KEY

outbound:
  execute:
    enabled: true
    https_only: true
    executor: live                 # real HTTPS
    allowed_hosts:
      - api.openai.com
      - api.anthropic.com
      - generativelanguage.googleapis.com
      # Add OpenRouter / DeepSeek / xAI / Fireworks as needed.

surface_dev_paths:
  ydltavern: /workspace/Yggdrasil/YdlTavern/packages/ydltavern-surface/dist
```

Three gates must all pass:

1. the profile permits the outbound executor to use the network;
2. the engine package manifest declares the target host;
3. the engine package manifest declares the `secret_ref` it uses.

Any missing gate fails closed. Default conformance does not use the network.

## Semantics of the three `secret_ref` forms

| Ref shape | Resolution path | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `secret_ref:env:NAME` | `EnvSecretResolver` (allowlist) | Development / CI / Docker |
| `secret_ref:store:NAME` | `StoreSecretResolver` (local encrypted store) | Desktop users, platform-wide sharing |
| `secret_ref:project:NAME` | `ProjectStoreSecretResolver` | Project isolation with optional platform fallback |

See [`SECRET_MANAGEMENT.md`](SECRET_MANAGEMENT.en.md).

## Where `session_id` comes from

Each running project has a kernel session, created by the host during `project.start`:

```text
session.id = ksess_xxx
session.metadata.project_id = "youzini-afk__YdlTavern__d2a47e5c"
session.labels = ["project:youzini-afk__YdlTavern__d2a47e5c"]
```

The `clients/web` main thread receives `session_id` from `kernel.v1.project.start`. It then calls `kernel.v1.surface.resolve_bundle` to get the surface bundle URL and uses `mountSurface` to create the iframe.

The iframe `initialProps` include:

```json
{
  "projectId": "youzini-afk__YdlTavern__d2a47e5c",
  "sessionId": "ksess_xxx"
}
```

Inside the surface, `callHostRpc` / `invokeCapability` automatically carries this `session_id`. When the host receives an RPC with `session_id`, it sets `ProtocolContext.session_id` and carries it to outbound dispatch.

There, the runtime reads `project_id` from session metadata, sets the `ACTIVE_PROJECT_SCOPE` task-local, and resolves `secret_ref:project:*` within that scope.

See [`PROJECT_MODEL.md`](PROJECT_MODEL.en.md).

## How project scope affects secrets

Project scope is not decided by a string the surface claims. It is decided by the session the host created:

1. `project.start` creates or reuses a project session.
2. Session metadata stores `project_id`.
3. Later RPCs carry `session_id`.
4. `dispatch_outbound_execute` finds the session from `ProtocolContext.session_id`.
5. The runtime sets `ProjectScopeContext`.
6. `ProjectStoreSecretResolver` reads the matching project store.

This prevents a surface from reading another project's secrets by forging `projectId`. The current model is still soft isolation; stronger multi-tenant project identity in `ProtocolContext` is Round 11+.

## Permission and audit boundaries

A real model call must pass all of these boundaries:

- `kernel.v1.capability.invoke` checks caller context and capability handles.
- The engine package manifest declares `ydltavern/engine/model.live_call`.
- The engine package manifest declares `permissions.network.declarations`.
- The engine package manifest declares `permissions.secret_refs`.
- The host profile enables a live executor and allowlists the target host.
- The secret resolver successfully resolves the reference.

Audit records store only the target host, method, package/capability, redaction state, executor kind, `secret_ref` references, and related metadata. They do not store raw API keys, prompt bodies, or provider responses.

## Troubleshooting

### `no project resolver configured`

The host profile has `secret_resolver.store_enabled: false`, but the user attempted `secret_ref:project:*`. Set it to true or use `secret_ref:env:*`.

### `session has no metadata.project_id`

Starting through `yg project start` or Home Play sets this automatically. If the surface bypasses the project flow, create a session with `metadata.project_id` manually or avoid project refs.

### `host '...' not in outbound.allowed_hosts`

The profile's `outbound.execute.allowed_hosts` is missing this provider host. Add it and restart the host.

### `secret_ref '...' not declared in package permissions`

The engine package manifest did not declare the ref in `permissions.secret_refs`. Edit the manifest and reload the package.

### `401 Unauthorized` from provider

The secret store value is usually wrong, or the provider changed the auth header format. Paste the API key again and verify that the provider/profile matches the key type.

### The surface receives no reply

Check that Play returned `session_id`, iframe `initialProps.sessionId` is non-empty, `callHostRpc` carries `session_id`, and the host outbound executor is `live` rather than the default deny/fake path.

## Implementation locations

- [`SECRET_MANAGEMENT.md`](SECRET_MANAGEMENT.en.md) — resolver chain and project fallback.
- [`PROJECT_MODEL.md`](PROJECT_MODEL.en.md) — project + session pairing.
- `/workspace/Yggdrasil/YdlTavern/packages/ydltavern-surface/src/app/TavernProvider.tsx::sendMessage`
- `/workspace/Yggdrasil/YdlTavern/packages/ydltavern-engine/src/capabilities/model-live-call.ts`
- `crates/ygg-runtime/src/runtime/protocol_dispatch.rs::dispatch_outbound_execute`
- `crates/ygg-runtime/src/runtime/outbound.rs::LiveHttpOutboundExecutor`
- the `clients/web` surface-host iframe bridge and `mountSurface`.

## Deferred items

- Streaming response UX: the current v1 surface path updates non-streaming text; the engine and outbound layer already have streaming primitives, but surface consumption is a Wave 3.6+ follow-up.
- Concurrent active projects: current host scope flows through project sessions; stronger multi-tenant `project_id` in `ProtocolContext` is Round 11+.
- Real paths and managed host lifecycle in the Tauri shell: Round 11+.
- Production cross-origin surface-bundle allowlists and CSP hardening.
