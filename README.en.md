**An extensible creation platform for AI-native worlds, games, stories, and play.**

It has three tiers: a small, restrained, opinion-free kernel; an open ecosystem of capability packages; and projects on Home that can be installed, started, and stopped. Every meaningful concept on the platform — characters, prompts, models, agents, worlds, rules, memory — comes from a package, not the kernel; projects are host-runtime concepts.

## Why this exists

Most AI-native creative tools today split their users in two: players who consume a finished experience, and developers who build it. **Yggdrasil refuses that split.**

A player can inspect the session, ask an assistant to change something, fork it, swap one capability package for another, and ship the result back. A creator works against the same public protocol, with the same packages, in the same surfaces. The substrate is the same in both directions.

For the full product stance, see [`docs/product/PLAY_CREATION_MODEL.md`](docs/product/PLAY_CREATION_MODEL.en.md).

## Center of gravity

- The kernel hosts capability packages and nothing else.
- Every meaningful concept comes from a capability package.
- Official packages have no privileges — same manifest, same fabric, same permission gate.
- Creators are free to compose, replace, or write their own packages.

The platform's job is to make radical AI-native creation possible — not to give any "official path" a head start.

## Status

The platform substrate is in place. Contract V1 is the public platform spec; see [`docs/spec/KERNEL_V1_CONTRACT.md`](docs/spec/KERNEL_V1_CONTRACT.en.md). The next stage isn't more substrate sprawl — real playable experiences pull what comes next.

For the detailed status, capability inventory, and partial / deferred items, see [`docs/ALPHA_STATUS.md`](docs/ALPHA_STATUS.en.md). For what's next, see [`docs/roadmap/NEXT_STEPS.md`](docs/roadmap/NEXT_STEPS.en.md).

## Quick start

Run a host:

```bash
cargo run -p ygg-cli -- host serve \
  --http 127.0.0.1:8787 \
  --profile profiles/forge-alpha.yaml
```

Check or build the web shell:

```bash
npm run check --prefix clients/web
npm run build --prefix clients/web
```

Run the full conformance suite:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
cargo run -p ygg-cli -- conformance
```

Install and manage capability packages:

```bash
yg install github.com/user/yggdrasil-package#v1.2.0
yg list-installed
yg project list
yg project start <project-id>
yg project stop <project-id>
yg uninstall <package-id-or-project-id>
yg update [<package-id>]
yg lockfile --check
```

Run the blank play-creation loop end to end via the public protocol:

```bash
cargo run -p ygg-cli -- play-create-demo
```

For more commands (manifest, package, composition, host modes, third-party authoring loop, templates), see [`docs/guides/PACKAGE_AUTHORING_WALKTHROUGH.md`](docs/guides/PACKAGE_AUTHORING_WALKTHROUGH.en.md).

## Documentation

Every developer doc has both English and Simplified Chinese versions; the bilingual blockquote at the top of each file switches between them. [`docs/`](docs/README.en.md) is grouped by topic: architecture, protocol, spec, product, package authoring, performance, roadmap, tavern compatibility.

Shortest path by intent:

## Deferred

These are valuable directions, but they don't belong in the kernel — they will arrive as ordinary capability packages:

- YdlTavern — a separate integration project compatible with SillyTavern's resources and extensions, running on Yggdrasil ([`docs/tavern/TAVERN_COMPAT.md`](docs/tavern/TAVERN_COMPAT.en.md)).
- Production-grade long-running autonomous agents, multi-agent collaboration, production memory systems, world simulation, directors.
- External game-engine integrations (UE5, Godot, Unity, web clients).
- A full Studio, ComfyUI-style node editors, a marketplace.
- Final UI visual design.
