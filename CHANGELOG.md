# Changelog

All notable changes to Yggdrasil will be documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Vite bundling and iframe-based SurfaceHost in clients/web (S1)
- Tauri 2.x desktop wrapper at clients/desktop (S2)
- Loopback-only managed Desktop Host sidecar with a durable SQLite profile,
  random-port readiness handshake, and one-time cookie bootstrap
- Installable Web PWA shell with responsive mobile navigation
- Durable, expiring, revocable Host device grants with action scopes and
  one-time HTTPS pairing
- Mobile control of projects, deployment, and controlled development through
  the same Host API/RPC boundary
- Durable controlled-development ChangeSet journal, Host lease, scratch
  verification, managed promotion, and recovery
- Durable Build & Deploy jobs and deployment revisions with explicit recovery
  and rollback
- Explicit proxy-route exposure: Host-authenticated by default, public vhost
  only after an explicit user choice
- GitHub Actions CI and release workflows (S3)
- `scripts/release-version.sh` for version stamping
- `BUILDING.md` with cross-platform build instructions
- This changelog

### Security
- Query-string Host credentials are accepted only by the two browser SSE
  endpoints; ordinary RPC and Host API requests require Bearer or cookie auth
- Cookie-authenticated mutations enforce same-origin `Origin` when present
- Pairing and access journals persist only domain-separated credential digests

### Outbound (prior to S-track)
- `kernel.v1.outbound.execute` for unary HTTPS
- `kernel.v1.outbound.stream` for SSE/NDJSON streaming
- `kernel.v1.outbound.websocket.*` for bidirectional WebSocket
- Outbound completion audit events
- Manifest `permissions.secret_refs` declarations
- Subprocess SDK reverse `kernel.v1.*` dispatch + `kernelClient.openWebSocket`

## [0.1.0] — TBD (initial release)

Initial public release.
