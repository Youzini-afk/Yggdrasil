# @yggdrasil/kernel-sdk

Generated TypeScript bindings for the Yggdrasil kernel contract.

```ts
import { attach, fromHttpRpc } from "@yggdrasil/kernel-sdk";

const client = attach(fromHttpRpc("http://localhost:8080/rpc"));
const info = await client.hostInfo({});
```

`hostInfo()` uses the layered canonical route. Explicit legacy wire wrappers are generated when
an alias exists, for example `legacyKernelV1HostInfo({})`. To require an exact host contract before
subsequent calls:

```ts
await client.negotiateHost({
  profile: "ygg.contract.default/v1",
  versions: [{ layer: "host", version: "0.1.0" }],
});
```

Negotiation fails if the transport cannot carry the selection; it is never silently ignored.
HTTP and stdio transports queue top-level Contract Registry diagnostics across concurrent and
non-diagnostic responses. After a call through an explicit legacy wrapper, use
`client.drainContractDiagnostics()` to read and clear migration warnings without changing the
method result.

The generated types come from `docs/spec/v1/schemas/`. Regenerate with:

```bash
bash scripts/regen-sdks.sh
```

This package can be consumed from npm or via a workspace path reference:

```json
{ "dependencies": { "@yggdrasil/kernel-sdk": "file:../yggdrasil/sdk/typescript/kernel-sdk" } }
```
